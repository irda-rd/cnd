Description: The compositional nutrient diagnosis (CND) estimates imbalances in the nutrient composition of plant tissues, from the latter and its associated yield. The package aims to offer a platform on which to categorize and implement the different variants of the method. It also makes available the method developed by the Research and development institute for the agri-environment (IRDA) in the context of the development of the Quebec's fertilization reference charts.
